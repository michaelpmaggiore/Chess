I am confident that our endeavor to create a simple chess game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without relying on external libraries, is worthy of the full 100 points.
Here are some of the formidable challenges we encountered and successfully overcame during the development process:

1) Crafting the move validation logic for each chess piece proved to be a substantial hurdle, particularly for intricate pieces like the knight, bishop, queen, and rook. 
The meticulous implementation of rules for these pieces demanded a keen understanding of chess dynamics.

2) A significant obstacle we confronted was ensuring that the queen, bishop, or rook moved exclusively to their designated targets. 
Initially, these pieces navigated through their own or the opponent's pieces, undermining the strategic essence of piece placement on the board. 
Extensive movement validation was incorporated, iterating through multiple targets to guarantee that the pieces moved intelligently and did not surpass their intended boundaries.

3) Personally, I, Michael Maggiore, gleaned invaluable insights throughout the game's construction, emphasizing the critical principle that a program executes precisely what we instruct
it to do. This realization was particularly evident when troubleshooting issues such as pieces stacking or phasing through one another. 
The process also enhanced my understanding of chess board design, allowing me to apply my newfound skills to a game I deeply cherish.

4) Among the noteworthy features we implemented, a personal favorite of mine is the queen's ability to interact realistically with unitsâ€”coming to a halt upon encountering the first 
unit in its path. Achieving this outcome required hours of dedicated effort and a profound comprehension of the underlying mechanics.

5) Overall, we take immense pride in our final product. While we did not reach the stage of implementing a fully-fledged AI opponent,
the learning experience was invaluable. With over 550 lines of code, we successfully applied the skills acquired in this class to bring forth a project born out of passion. 
We appreciate the opportunity given to us and thank you for the chance to showcase our abilities!
